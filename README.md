This is a fork from [introJs](https://github.com/usablica/intro.js)

It fix some unwanted behavior whith scrollbar. When a element is in a container with a scrollbar, or in severals ones, it move the scrollbar to make the element visible in the viewport when this one is enlighted.

It use some jQuery method to do the hard work.

It also add a beforeChange event.

see an example at [http://platane.github.com/intro.js/index.html](http://platane.github.com/intro.js/index.html)
